# 🔥 How Streaks Work - Quick Guide

## What is a Streak?

A **streak** counts how many days in a row you've solved at least one coding problem. It's a fun way to stay consistent with your practice!

## How to Build Your Streak

### Start Your Streak
1. Go to the **Practice** page
2. Solve any coding problem
3. Submit your solution ✅
4. Your streak begins at **1 day**! 🎉

### Maintain Your Streak
- Solve **at least one problem** every day
- Each consecutive day adds **+1** to your streak
- Your streak is updated automatically when you submit a solution

### Example Timeline:
```
Monday:    Solve 1 problem  → Streak: 1 🔥
Tuesday:   Solve 2 problems → Streak: 2 🔥🔥
Wednesday: Solve 1 problem  → Streak: 3 🔥🔥🔥
Thursday:  Solve 0 problems → Streak: 1 💔 (resets!)
Friday:    Solve 1 problem  → Streak: 1 🔥 (starts over)
```

## Streak Rules 📋

✅ **Same Day**: Solving multiple problems on the same day keeps your streak (doesn't increment)

✅ **Next Day**: Solving a problem the next day increments your streak by 1

❌ **Skip a Day**: Missing a day resets your streak to 1

🏆 **Longest Streak**: Your best streak ever is saved as a record!

## Common Questions ❓

**Q: What if I solve multiple problems in one day?**
A: Great! But your streak only increases once per day. The total problems solved still counts toward the leaderboard.

**Q: What time does the day reset?**
A: The system uses midnight (00:00) in your local timezone as the day boundary.

**Q: Can I see my streak history?**
A: Currently, you can see your current streak and longest streak. Detailed history may come in future updates!

**Q: What happens if I re-solve a problem in a different language?**
A: Your solution is saved, but it doesn't count as a new problem for leaderboard ranking. Your streak still updates!

**Q: Does the leaderboard reset?**
A: No, it's all-time rankings based on total problems solved.
